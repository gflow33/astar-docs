# Introduction

To make use of this documentation most effectively, you should possess a general understanding of blockchain and programming basics, however, lack of which should not discourage you from following along, or even deploying live contracts. The purpose of this guide is to provide the cursory knowledge required to transition from being a user of decentralized applications (dApps) and blockchain, to a developer, by performing *practical hands-on examples*, that are designed for all skill levels.

The specific programming languages used throughout these sections are mainly Rust, Solidity, and JavaScript, for which previous knowledge is not necessary, but would be highly beneficial, so in order to gain a deeper understanding of the topics and practical examples within these sections, we recommend reviewing supplemental material covering these languages.

Check out the following links for more information about [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn) and [JavaScript](https://www.freecodecamp.org/).

### I'm Building for the Polkadot & Kusama Ecosystem, Should I Read This?
If you are already building in the Polkadot/Kusama ecosystem, you can skip the Introduction section, and jump straight to the [Network](./astar_family.md) section.
