# Test Tokens

A faucet is a automated system designed to dispense test tokens. Faucets are available for all Shibuya accounts, and Astar and Shiden accounts with empty balances. Faucets can be used to fund your wallet with enough assets to cover transaction and deployment costs.

Let's examine three ways to obtain SBY tokens for your Shibuya account.
