# Setup the Development Environment
You will not need to know how to set up these environments prior to commencing development, however, may want to review the following sections to familiarize yourself with what they do, and each of their specific requirements.

For example, if building ink! smart contracts you will most likely be using an ink! Environment and Swanky Node, whereas, when ready to deploy your application to production, you will want to review the section about setting up your own RPC endpoint.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
